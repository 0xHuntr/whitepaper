# NFTs for Wireshape Contributors

Each 3D project created on Wireshape 3D scan cloud platform generates Wireshape NFTs that will be distributed to the co-authors of such a project. These NFTs can be collected, traded in decentralized marketplaces or transferred as they wish.&#x20;

The owners of these NFTs will receive recurring payments in $WIRE tokens from Wireshape Library Subscriptions. The entire amount received in $WIRE for the subscriptions will be distributed in full to the owners of these NFTs.
