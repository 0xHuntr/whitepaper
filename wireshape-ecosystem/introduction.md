# Introduction

## Why Wireshape?

Wireshape ecosystem has been developed to help the 3D computer graphics industry achieve fast and accurate results. This new approach will allow the popularization of the use of AAA 3D models. With our solution, metaverse, game and visual effects productions will be able to save time and money while raising the level of realism of their content.

The traditional creation of 3D models requires a slow and complex pipeline, which starts with research and conceptual design, goes through 3D modeling and then texturing, where colors and details are added. We aim to free artists so they can finally dedicate themselves to creative work, to create the unimagined instead of spending days trying to reproduce the real world.
