# Introduction

## Why Wireshape?

Wireshape ecosystem has been developed to help the 3D computer graphics industry achieve fast and accurate results. This new approach will allow the popularization of the use of AAA 3D models. With our solution, metaverse, game and visual effects productions will be able to save time and money while raising the level of realism of their content.

The traditional creation of 3D models requires a slow and complex pipeline, which starts with research and conceptual design, goes through 3D modeling and then texturing, where colors and details are added. We aim to free artists so they can finally dedicate themselves to creative work, to create the unimagined instead of spending days trying to reproduce the real world.

## What makes Wireshape unique?

There are a few key reasons that make Wireshape different, whether as a 3D model provider or a software provider.

1. Wireshape is focused on delivering exclusively 3D scanned models, with quality and delivery standards compatible with the main tools on the market.
2. Our software is capable of generating high definition 3D models in the cloud from photos.
3. We work with contributing photographers from around the world, who upload their photos through our platform to generate the 3D models automatically in the cloud.
4. We utilize decentralized finance to ensure our global reach with reduced cost of international financial transactions and greater accessibility.
5. We guarantee the right to receive royalties through NFTs. Wireshape distributes its revenue from subscriptions to the 3D Scanned Assets Stock in $WIRE to contributors or those who own these special NFTs.
