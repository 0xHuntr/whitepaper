# 3D Scan Contributor Platform

Wireshape 3D Scan Contributor Plarform is our cloud-based system that converts images into fully accurate and realistic 3D objects through photogrammetry technology.

Contributing photographers around the world upload images on the platform, that processes these images and generates 3D models with a high level of detail.&#x20;

The 3D models are then made available online on Wireshape 3D Scan Library, where through a subscription plan, metaverse, VFX and game producers, can choose, download and put it in their productions.

Each 3D project created on Wireshape Contributor Platform generates Wireshape NFTs that will be distributed to the co-authors of such a project. Check here for more details: [nfts-for-wireshape-contributors.md](nfts/nfts-for-wireshape-contributors.md "mention")

On the platform, the contributor can:

* **Create projects** by sending images to become 3D objects.
* **Add** project **name** and **description**.
* **Monitor the status** of project processing.
* **Track 3D objects** that he/she is co-author.
* **Check how many NFTs** he/she owns and **how many $WIRE tokens** is entitled to receive.
