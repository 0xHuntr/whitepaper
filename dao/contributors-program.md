# Contributors Program

At Wireshape Blockchain, we believe that the power of decentralization lies in the ability to create a collaborative and transparent environment where all users can contribute to the project's growth. That's why we've created the product data contribution program to incentivize and reward users for their contributions.

By contributing product data, users not only help to create a more comprehensive database, but they also earn WIRE tokens, utility tokens necessary for the continuous registry of data within the blockchain.&#x20;

The program is designed to ensure exclusivity by only accepting high-quality product data. This approach ensures that users can trust the data and the decisions made based on it, creating a more reliable and trustworthy platform.

At the core of our philosophy is the belief in collaboration and transparency, and this program embodies those principles. We encourage all users to contribute to the platform's growth and help create a more open and inclusive environment for all.

The product data contribution program at Wireshape Blockchain is an excellent opportunity for users to be a part of something big, while also earning rewards for their contributions. We believe in the power of collaboration, transparency, and exclusivity to create a more decentralized world, and this program is just one small step towards that goal.
